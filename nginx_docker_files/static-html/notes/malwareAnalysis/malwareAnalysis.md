# Malware analysis

This page purpose is to be a reference for myself in order to perform the art of malware analysis.  

The first thing we need is a virtual machine (VM) designed to perform malware analysis, the de facto VM is the Flare VM, designed by Mandiant
## Flare VM
Flare VM is a VM that it's install over vanilal windows 10. We can find de official github repository in here [flareVM github](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm).
In order to install the VM you must have a software for virtualization. The one I use is virtualbox, the reason is because it's free and widly used in the develpment comunity, (for example it's used by [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) to emulate rooted andriod devices, wich in turn are used to perform pentest in andriod applications).

On Kali linux I had some struggles with the installition of virtualbox, the most common solution I had is to update and upgrade everything with `apt update` and `apt upgrade` then instaling virtualbox. We must install the packages `virtualbox` and `virtualbox-ext-pack`, if it's not install automaticaly we must install `virtualbox-dkms` 

## REMnux 
[REMnux](https://remnux.org/) it's another VM for malware analysis, the diference with Flare VM is that REMnux is bases in linux and we can download it as a .ova file that can be imported to our virtualizing software
